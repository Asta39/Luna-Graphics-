    longDescription: `Magic Mugs (color changing mugs) create a memorable surprise. The black heat-sensitive coating conceals your design until hot liquid is added, revealing the vibrant image beneath. A guaranteed conversation starter!

How It Works:
The mug appears solid black at room temperature. When filled with hot liquid (coffee, tea, hot chocolate), the heat-sensitive coating becomes transparent, revealing your printed design. As the mug cools, it returns to black.

Design Tips:
- Design shows through black coating, so light colors work best
- White backgrounds create dramatic reveal
- Perfect for "before and after" concepts
- Add surprise messages that appear with heat`,
